# Sepsis-and-Septic-shock-Prediction-model
- ML model for Sepsis and Septic shock Prediction in patients admitted in ICU.
Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threating organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response\nto infection. In septic shock, there is critical reduction in tissue perfusion; acute failures\nin multiple organs, including lungs, kidneys and liver can occur.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predict sepsis in advance so that the treatment can be given at the right time.
